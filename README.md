# üîó Usage

<p> So basically discord doesn't allows to scrap all the members of a discord server, but there are workaround, there are 2 methods in this repo to scrap the members </p>
First off download the source code from <a href="https://github.com/RishitChaudhary/Discord-members-scapper/releases/tag/Zip"> here </a> and extract all the files in the same folder.

<h3> Method 1 </h3>

So in this method we'll use `fetch_user_1.py` to scrap the members, this script will basically scrap the members that are visible in the sidebar i.e. online members, it will scrap all the members in a small server because even the offline members are visible in the sidebar, but in a big server the offline members are not visible so it won't be able to scrap those members, this method is pretty fast.

<h4> Usage </h4>

Open the `fetch_users_1.py` in a text editor of your choice and put your token in the `token` variable in line 4 and server id in `guild_id` variable in line 5, make sure the token is in the server.

<br> <br>
<h5> Now just run the file: </h5>
<br>

Click `Window+r` and type `cmd` then click `enter`

Type in the following commands:
<pre> cd "path-to-the-folder-where-you-extracted-the-files" </pre>
<pre> python fetch_users_1.py </pre>
<h3> Method 2 </h3>

So this method might be more efficient but more slow, in this method the bot will go through every message in a channel and return the id of the person who sent that message, this method might be better because it'll scrap active members and more members if a server is big, but it can be very slow because the channels can have millions of messages so it might even break while scrapping.

<h4> Usage </h4>

Open the `fetch_users_2.py` in a text editor of your choice and put your token in the `token` variable in line 4 and channel id in `channel_id` variable in line 5, make sure the token is in the server of that channel and have access to view and read message history of that channel.

 If your token/main account gets disabled I am not responsible for it, Use these scripts at your own risk, this project was just made for learning purposes.
